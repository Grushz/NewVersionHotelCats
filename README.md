# NewVersionHotelCats
<p>HotelCats return again with new code and function inside</p>
<p>Date 02.05.2024</p>
<h3>Update list:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Added a lot of CSS animations</li>
<li>Fixed duplicate IDs</li>
<li>Pixso developer mode discovered</li>
<li>MORE pseudo elements</li>
<li>OverFlow hidden for main container "YOU SHALL NOT PASS"</li>
<li>Margin in contacts</li>
<li>Links like only #</li>
<li>Popup in &lt;form&gt; updated</li>
<li>Added placeholder styling</li>
<li>The cross became a button</li>
<li>Update class="hidden" and added class="show"... All for smoothness</li>
<li>I tried to solve the problem with the classes, as a result, the classes kicked me out</li>
<li>Added JS for the popup and for room and review changer (P.S. Don't look at the code, I'm scared myself, but I really want to figure it out.)</li>
<li>Added MORE classes (But I don't know if this is normal)</li>
<li>Added new CSS document for animation </li>
</ol>
<p> To sum up, there are still many subtleties that are worth exploring, I need to learn how to work with classes correctly and find common ones. And also make the java script code beautiful and understandable. But damn it, it's alive and working... (At least for now)</p>
